Here is how to set a dark theme on Geany on LXQT.

Geany is a GTK application, so you need to set the
GTK theme as dark.

On LUbuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) this is done like this:


1) HOME BUTTON > Preferences > LXQt Settings > Appearance

Here on the Widget Style tab by default the GTK2 and GTK3
themes are set to "Arc-Darker". Set them both to "Ark-Dark".

2) If you have Geany open - close it and open it again

This changes the application colors, but NOT the editor colors.
To change the editor colors you do this separately, by
choosing a theme from:

https://www.geany.org/download/themes/

Where you can download and install any dark theme you want,
including my dark theme "evg-ega-dark".
