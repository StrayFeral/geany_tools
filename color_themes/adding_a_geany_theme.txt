-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The original python code to add Geany themes is written in Python 2.
As of today the code was not fully ported. So in case of problems,
this is what I did, to regenerate the json index files:

sudo docker image pull python:2
sudo docker run -it python:2 bash

# From now on, the rest is executed on the container shell.
# By the way the container is a Debian 10 image with Python 2.7.18

apt update
apt upgrade
apt install wget

# This however does not seem to work, maybe it is only the Python 3 version
apt install python-pil

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Pillow is a fork of PIL. In my case PIL did not worked
pip install pillow

cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/geany/geany-themes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd geany-themes-master/

# Now copy-paste your new theme_name.conf in colorschemes/
# and then your screenshot_name.png in screenshots/

make clean
make index

# In 2023 the folowing is a bit barbarian, I know. But it works.
# You can go in a better way if you mount your native filesystem to
# the container, but I was in a hurry and as I said - it works.

# So now we simply cat the files we need and we copy-paste them
# in our native filesystem:
cat index.json.md5
cat index.json # This one is large !
