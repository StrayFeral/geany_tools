# geany_tools
Some Geany (www.geany.org) tools I coded.

import_geany_project.pl
-----------------------
Perl script I coded (2020-03-17) to help me import the simple Geany project files, I use to copy between my home and office computers. This is a command-line utility. Read the begining of the file for detailed description and edit between lines 177 and 197 to do your own setup.
